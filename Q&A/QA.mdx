### What is Gleef?
Gleef is a Chrome extension designed for A/B testing website wording to enhance user engagement and conversion rates. Gleef focuses exclusively on testing text elements, not other webpage components.

### How does Gleef work?
Gleef allows you to create, manage, and analyze A/B tests by experimenting with different text variations on your website. This JavaScript overlay adjusts your website’s text dynamically, all without any developer intervention or changes to your live product.

### What are the benefits of using Gleef?
Gleef helps boost conversion rates, enhance user engagement, and optimize overall website performance by testing and refining your wording. As an expert in text-based A/B testing, Gleef facilitates easy experimentation with wording changes—no coding skills required. Developers love Gleef because it doesn’t interfere with the website structure, unlike traditional A/B testing solutions.

### What types of tests does Gleef allow?
Gleef specializes in A/B testing for text elements, such as headlines, buttons, and product descriptions.

### Who can use Gleef?
Gleef is ideal for marketers, product managers, developers, and anyone involved in website optimization.

### Is Gleef compatible with all browsers?
- **For Website Owners:** Gleef is primarily designed for Google Chrome, allowing for easy experiment implementation and tracking.
- **For Visitors:** Gleef operates seamlessly on any browser. As it integrates a simple JavaScript code, it functions across all devices and browsers.

### Why can't I remove the baseline text from variations?
The original text you are testing becomes the baseline, serving as the benchmark for your comparison. Therefore, you cannot remove the baseline text from your variations.

### What is the difference between Gleef and other A/B testing tools?
Gleef stands out by specifically focusing on A/B testing for website wording. While traditional A/B testing tools are great for evaluating UI/UX elements, Gleef hones in on the power of words. This unique specialization brings several distinct benefits:

- **Focused Expertise in Wording:** 
  Gleef is dedicated to optimizing text elements, understanding that the right words can remarkably influence user behavior. Whether legal text, brand image, or tone of voice, precise wording is critical for effective communication.

- **Complements Traditional UI Testing Tools:** 
  Gleef doesn't aim to replace traditional A/B testing tools but to complement them. While UI tests are crucial for enhancing visual and functional aspects of a website, wording tests are vital for clear communication and user engagement.

- **Emphasizes the Importance of Words:**
  Words play a pivotal role in legal compliance, brand perception, and customer engagement. The right message can build trust, convey brand values, and motivate users to take meaningful actions.

- **Builds a Community of Engaged Users:**
  Gleef fosters a vibrant community of marketers, product managers, and developers focused on the nuanced power of words. Our platform supports collaboration and the sharing of insights to improve communication strategies effectively.

- **Maintains a Developer-Friendly Approach:**
  By concentrating on text changes rather than UI modifications, Gleef minimizes the risk of affecting site functionality. Developers appreciate that our approach doesn't interfere with the site’s design or performance, making implementation and management seamless.

In summary, Gleef’s focus on wording makes it a unique and valuable tool in the A/B testing landscape. It allows teams to refine their messaging with precision, ensuring that every word enhances the user experience and strengthens engagement.

### Are there any limitations on Gleef usage?
No, Gleef imposes no limitations on the number of experiments or users. You can create and run as many experiments as you need, and invite as many team members as you like to collaborate on your projects.

### How do I know which plan my company is on?
