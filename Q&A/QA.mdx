### What is Gleef?
Gleef is a Chrome extension for A/B testing website wording to optimize user engagement and conversion.
Gleef does not aim to A/B test other elements than wording on your website.

### How does Gleef work?
Gleef allows you to create, manage, and analyze A/B tests by experimenting different text variations on your website.
Gleef is a javascript overlay that will change the text of your website, without the intervention of any developers, nor any edition on your live product.

### What are the benefits of using Gleef?
It helps improve conversion rate, user engagement, and overall website performance by testing and optimizing wording.
On top of that, Gleef defines as the expert of words, meaning that it will enables you to easily test wording, without any coding skills or requirements.
It is a simple and easy to use solution, that is loved by developers as it does not interact directly with the website structure, in comparison to classic A/B testing solutions.

### What types of tests does Gleef allow?
Gleef focuses on A/B testing for text elements such as headlines, buttons, and product descriptions.

### Who can use Gleef?
Marketers, product managers, developers, and anyone involved in website optimization can use Gleef.

### Is Gleef compatible with all browsers?
On the **website owners' side**, Gleef is primarily designed for use with Google Chrome. This means that experiments' implementation and followup can be done using Google Chrome.
On the **visitor side**, Gleef works on any type of browser. As Gleef just adds a simple javascript on the website, it can work on any type of device, and any browser.

### Why can't I remove the basic text from the variations?
As you're performing an experiment on a specific text, you won't have the possibility to remove the text you're running the experiment on.
It will become your baseline, and be the comparison for all other variations.

### What is the difference between Gleef and other A/B testing tools?
Gleef distinguishes itself by specializing in the A/B testing of website wording. While traditional A/B testing tools are excellent for testing UI/UX elements, Gleef focuses on the impact of words. This specialization brings several unique benefits:
- **Expertise in Wording:**
Gleef is dedicated to optimizing text elements, recognizing that the right wording can significantly influence user behavior. Whether it's legal text, brand image, or tone of voice, precise wording is crucial.
- **Complementary to UI Testing:**
We do not aim to replace traditional A/B testing tools but to complement them. While UI tests are essential for enhancing the visual and functional aspects of a site, wording tests are vital for communication and engagement.
- **Importance of Words:**
Words play a critical role in legal compliance, brand perception, and customer engagement. The right message can build trust, convey brand values, and prompt users to take action.
- **Community and Engagement:**
Gleef fosters a community of marketers, product managers, and developers focused on the power of words. Our platform supports collaboration and shared insights to improve communication strategies.
- **Developer-Friendly:**
By focusing on text changes rather than UI modifications, Gleef minimizes the risk of breaking site functionality. Developers appreciate that our approach does not interfere with the site's design or performance, making it easier to implement and manage.

In summary, Gleefâ€™s focus on wording makes it a unique and valuable tool in the A/B testing landscape. It allows teams to hone their messaging with precision, ensuring that every word contributes to a better user experience and stronger engagement.

### Will Gleef slower my website?
Gleef just adds a seemless script on your website, loading without any flickering in less than 25ms.
If you have flickering with Gleef, it probably means that you also have latencies with other javascripts on your website.

You can book an appointment with our experts in order to make sure we won't slower your website loading.

### Is there any limitations on Gleef usage?
We do not limit Gleef usage in terms of experiments or user.
This means that you can create as many experiments as you want, as well as having as many users as you want.

### How to know on which plan my company is?
