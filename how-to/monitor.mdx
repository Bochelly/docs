To monitor the results of your experiments, simply go to your dashboard and select the experiment you'd like to view.

## Edit the name of the experiment
You have the option to edit the `Test name` at any time, and regardless of the status of your experiment (`Draft`, `In Progress`, `Paused`, `Finished`).

Simply edit it and then save the changes.

<Note>To prevent bias in your experiment, the only criteria you can update once it has been saved is the name. For additional information, please visit our [FAQ](/Q&A/QA)</Note>

## Start/Pause the experiment
### Drafted experiment
<img width="200" src="/images/monitor_draft.png" alt="Draft experiment"/>

When you create an experiment, you have the option to save it as a draft instead of running it directly. A `Draft` experiment signifies it has never run and therefore, doesn't have any data to display. You can start the experiment whenever you're ready.

<Warning>If an experiment has been in the "draft" stage for a while, it's important to verify that the page hasn't undergone any changes in the meantime, so that the targeted wording for the experiment is still relevant.</Warning>

### Paused experiment

When an experiment is `Paused`, it means that it was previously launched but then stopped. At this point, visitors will only see the baseline. The experiment may have some saved data from when it was live. To restart a paused experiment, click the restart button. The experiment will then display variations to visitors and the new data collected will be added to the previous data.

### Running experiment

If you need to pause an experiment that's currently in progress, it will no longer be live on your webpage. However, you can still switch it back on later to collect more data.

There are several reasons why you might want to pause an experiment:

- The wording under experiment has been removed from the page, and you need to add it back.
- You have a specific event on your website that you don't want the experiment to be biased by.

<Warning>You might not want to pause an experiment too long, as it could have an impact on the results (introduce bias).</Warning>

When you pause an experiment that is significant, it will get the status `finished` meaning that it is not running anymore, and that it is signficant.


## Finish the experiment
When the experiment is statistically significant, you can pause it, leading the experiment to get the status `finished`. 
Start analyzing the results!


## Analyze results
### Significance

Significance is a mathematical term that depends on many different parameters. Gleef automatically calculates significance for you.
You can see how it is done on our [statistical explanations](/Q&A/statistics-data).

<Tip>You can now see `p-value`and `Z-value`.</Tip>

You should keep the experiment running while the significance is not achieved, as the results have not reached the desired outcome and should not be considered.
Keep in mind that the significance is directly linked to the square of the conversion difference calculated between variations, which means that if you have a 10% difference between 2 variations, your experiment will be significant 100 times quicker than a 1% difference.

### Conversion & growth

At any moment, you can access see & follow the results of your experiment, seeing the conversion of each variations, and the growth in comparison to the `baseline` which is the basic wording under experiment.

<Tip>
    When hovering conversion or growth metrics, you can access detailed figures
