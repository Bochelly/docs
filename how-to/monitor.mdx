To monitor the results of your experiments, simply go to your dashboard and select the experiment you'd like to view.

## Edit experiment
Despite the experiment status (`Draft`, `In Progress`, `Paused`, `Finished`), you can only edit the name of the experiment once it has been saved.

Directly change the name of the experiment and save it.

<Note>You can not change anything else as it is likely to introduce bias in your experiment, as explained in our [FAQ](/Q&A/QA)</Note>

## Start/Pause the experiment
### Drafted experiment
<img width="200" src="/images/monitor_draft.png" alt="Draft experiment"/>

When creating an experiment, you can choose to only save it as a draft, not running it live.
Thus, when an experiment is `drafted` it means that the experiment has not been running yet and so there is no data to display.
You can start the experiment whenever you want.

<Warning>When an experiment has been drafted for a long time, make sure that the page has not been change in the meantime, so that the wording targeted by the experiment is still on the page.</Warning>

### Paused experiment
<img width="200" src="/images/monitor_paused.png" alt="Not running experiment"/>

When an experiment is `Draft` or `Paused`, you can start it by clicking on the button.
Then, the experiment will be running on the webpage, so that variations will be shown to visitors.

### Running experiment
<img width="200" src="/images/monitor_running.png" alt="In progress experiment"/>

When an experiment is in progress, you can pause it, meaning that the experiment won't be running on your webpage anymore.
Pausing an experiment will still make it possible to switch it live again later, in order to gain even more data.

You can wish to pause an experiment for different reasons:
- You realised the wording under experiment has been removed from the page. You pause the experiment while you add it back.
- You have a very specific event on your website you don't wan't the experiment to be bias with.
- You are undergoing latencies or any technical issues with your website and want to reduce friction or flickering with third parts.

<Warning>You might not want to pause an experiment too long, as it could have an impact on the results (introduce bias).</Warning>

When you pause an experiment that is significant, it will get the status `finished` meaning that it is not running anymore, and that it is signficant.


## Finish the experiment
When the experiment is statistically significant, you can pause it, leading the experiment to get the status `finished`. 
Start analyzing the results!


## Analyze results
### Significance

Significance is a mathematical term that depends on many different parameters. Gleef automatically calculates significance for you.
You can see how it is done on our [statistical explanations](/Q&A/statistics-data).

<Tip>You can now see `p-value`and `Z-value`.</Tip>

You should keep the experiment running while the significance is not achieved, as the results have not reached the desired outcome and should not be considered.
Keep in mind that the significance is directly linked to the square of the conversion difference calculated between variations, which means that if you have a 10% difference between 2 variations, your experiment will be significant 100 times quicker than a 1% difference.

### Conversion & growth
<img width="200" src="/images/monitor_results.png" alt="Results"/>
At any moment, you can access see & follow the results of your experiment, seeing the conversion of each variations, and the growth in comparison to the `baseline` which is the basic wording under experiment.

<Tip>
    When hovering conversion or growth metrics, you can access detailed figures
