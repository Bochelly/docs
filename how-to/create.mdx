Setting up your first experiment is a quick and easy process that should take less than 5 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Gleef's extension on the relevant page">
        Make sure to open Gleef's extension on the page you want to conduct the experiment.
        Otherwise, navigate on your website before opening the extension.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Login with your credentials">
        Your credentials are unique and must not be shared, as we are keeping a log of any edit done with Gleef, which would enable you to know who made an edit on the website.
        If you do not have credentials yet, you must ask your company to create some, by emailing us at support@gleef.eu.
        There are no limitations on the number of user.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step0.png" alt="step 0"/>
        Create the experiment by clicking on the 'New test", which will enable you to start the implementation.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select the wording to experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step1.png" alt="step 1"/>
        Select the wording on your website you want to experiment.
        If you can't select the wording you wanted to, it might be because it is an image, or not inside classic textual code tags.
        
        Please refer to our [FAQ](/Q&A/trouble-shooting#i-cant-select-some-text-on-my-website-why) if needed.
    
        <Note>
            If you choose a specific component and there are identical ones on the same page, they will all be impacted by the experiment. This is to maintain consistency across the page, and we will replace all components that are an exact match to the one you've selected.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define the variations">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step2.png" alt="step 2"/>
        Define the variations you want to experiment.
        Although Gleef doesn't impose a limit on variations, it's advisable to not create more than 2 variations (excluding the baseline) for optimal results.
        
        You can refer to our [best practices](/Q&A/best-practices) to know more on how to set-up a good experiment.

        <Tip>It's important to note that increasing the number of variations in your experiment will also increase the time it takes to achieve statistically significant results, [read more](/Q&A/statistics-data)</Tip>

        The 'baseline' cannot be removed as it represents the original wording that you are testing against in your A/B experiment.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define the success event of the experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step3.png" alt="step 3"/>
       In accordance with A/B testing best practices, Gleef provides the option to define two types of success events:
        1. **A click on the call-to-action:**
        When testing a call-to-action button, you can define the success event as a click on that button. This feature only works for clickable call-to-action text and records the first click as a success event linked to the variation shown.
        <Warning>We currently don't offer the option to select a call-to-action that is separate from the text you're testing. </Warning>
        
        2. **A specific URL page:**
        Specify a URL for a page that signifies a successful outcome for your experiment, such as a 'thank you' or 'purchase confirmed' page. This allows you to test elements like headlines that aren't tied to a specific call-to-action.
        
        Please refer to our [success-events page](/how-to/success-event) if needed.    
    </Step>

    <Step title="Name your experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step4.png" alt="step 4"/>
        After completing the setup, you will need to name your experiment to make it easy to locate on your Gleef dashboard. Gleef recommends to follow your company's naming conventions to make it clear to everyone which experiment is in progress.
        
        Experiment naming convention is "**Text in test** " & "**Page of the test**". Here are some examples:
        - **CTA 1 Landing:**
        You set an experiment on a CTA on your landing page with the highest hierrachy, for example the `Shop now` button.
        - **Headline About:**
        You set an experiment on the "Making progress inevitable" headline and set the success event on the `Contact us` CTA url.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save or launch your experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step5.png" alt="step 5"/>
        You've already reached the final step! You can save your experiment as a draft to run later or launch it immediately - the choice is yours!
    </Step>
