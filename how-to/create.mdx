Setting-up your first test is very easy, and should take you less than 5 minutes.
You will probably be able to set-up the next one in even less time.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Gleef's extension on the page">
        Be sure ton open Gleef's extension on the page you want to conduct the experiment.
        Otherwise, navigate on your website before opening the extension.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Login with your credentials">
        Your credentials are unique and must not be shared, as we are keeping a log of any edit done with Gleef, which would enable you to know who made an edit on the website.
        If you do not have credentials yet, you must ask your company to create some, by emailing us at support@gleef.eu.
        There is no limitation on the number of user you can have.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step0.png" alt="step 0"/>
        Create the experiment by clicking on the 'New Experiment", which will enable you to start the implementation.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select the wording to experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step1.png" alt="step 1"/>
        Select the wording on your website you want to experiment.
        If you can't select the wording you were willing to, it might be because it is defined on an image, or not inside classic textual code tags.
        
        Please refer to our [FAQ](/Q&A/trouble-shooting#i-cant-select-some-text-on-my-website-why) if needed.
    
        <Note>
            If the exact same component that you have selected is elsewhere on the same page, it will also be affected by the experiment.
            Meaning that we will replace all components that contains that are exactly the same as the one selected, to ensure consistency within the page.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define the variations">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step2.png" alt="step 2"/>
        Define the variaitons you want to experiment.
        In theory, you can add as many variations as you want, but we recommand you not to define more than 2 variations (excluding the baseline).

        You can refer to our [best practices](/Q&A/best-practices) to know more on how to set-up a good experiment.

        <Tip>Keep in mind that the more variations you set-up, the longer it will take to the experiment to be significant, [read more](/Q&A/statistics-data)</Tip>

        You don't have the possibility to remove the `baseline` which is the basic wording you are trying to A/B test.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define the success event of the expirement">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step3.png" alt="step 3"/>
        We offer the possibility to define 2 types of success event:
        1. **A click on the call-to-action:**
        <Warning>It only works if you're currently running the experiment on a call-to-action text, meaning a text that can be clicked to perform an event.</Warning>
        We do not yet provide the ability to select a call-to-action that is not the text you're trying to experiment, as it would make the experiment implementation process longer and we want to keep it straightforward.
        If you're currently running the experiment on a call-to-action, you can define the success event as being the click on that specific call-to-action, meaning that if the visitor click on that button for the first time, we perform the success event, and link it to the variation shown (if applicable).
        2. **A specific URL page**
        You can always provide a URL page, that would be a success for you. It can for instance be a 'thank you' page or 'purchase proceeded', right after the visitor has bought your product or service. It can also be anyother page that would be relevant.
        This enables testing a headline for instance, that is not linked to any particular call-to-action.
        
        Please refer to our [success-events page](/how-to/success-event) if needed.    
    </Step>

    <Step title="Name your experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step4.png" alt="step 4"/>
        Once everything is set-up, you have to name your experiment, in order to find it easily in your dashboard.
        Try to abide by the company's formatting when naming your experiments, to make it clear to everyone what is under experiment.

        Quick examples:
        - ** CTA on the landing page:**
        The CTA you're setting A/B testing on is the `discover` button. Then, the experiment should be named: `yy.mm-landingPage-CTA-discover`
        With `yy.mm` being the year and month of your test.
        - ** Headline on the landing page:**
        The headline you're setting A/B testing on is the `h1` header, meaning the title of your webpage. Then, the experiment should be named: `yy.mm-landingPage-h1-title`
        With `yy.mm` being the year and month of your test and `title` being the real title (shorten).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save your experiment">
        <img width="200" src="/images/create_step5.png" alt="step 5"/>
        When it's all done, you can save your experiment, and either let it as a draft to run it later, or launch it right away.
        It's your choice!
