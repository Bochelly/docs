Once your experiment is set-up, you can easily manage it's status.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Drafted]
    subgraph SP[Experiment running]
      direction TB
      B[Paused] --> C[In Progress]
      C --> B
    end
    A --> SP
    SP --> D[Finished]
````

An experiment can be in four different states:
    1. **`Draft`:**
    When you create the experiment and choose not to launch it immediatly, it is saved a draft, meaning that this experiment has never been launched.
    2. **`Running`:**
    When this experiment is currently running, meaning that visitors will see different variations of this experiment when going on the url linked to this experiment.
    3. **`Paused`:**
    You can decide to pause an experiment at any time. When paused, the experiment can be re-started manually when you want.
    When paused, the experiment is not running anymore, meaning that every visitor on your website will see the basic wording for that specific experiment.
    4. **`Finished`:**
    A finished experiment is an experiment that you have stopped and that have yeild significant results.

<Note>Note that changing too many times between running/pause can bias your experiment.</Note>
