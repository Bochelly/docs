Once your experiment is set up, you can effortlessly manage its status throughout its lifecycle.

An experiment can be in one of four different states:
    1. **`Draft`:**
    When you create an experiment but choose not to launch it immediately, it is saved as a draft. This means the experiment has never been launched.
    2. **`Running`:**
    When an experiment is running, visitors will see different variations associated with the experiment when they visit the linked URL.
    3. **`Paused`:**
    You can pause an experiment at any time. When an experiment is paused, it can be manually restarted whenever you choose. While paused, the experiment stops running, and all visitors will see the default text for that specific experiment.<Note>If you pause an experiment, you might still see the different variations on your website for up to 7 days. Donâ€™t worry; new visitors will not be subject to the experiment. Learn more about this in our [FAQ.](/Q&A/trouble-shooting#i-have-paused-an-experiment-but-still-see-live-variations-on-my-website-why)</Note>
    4. **`Finished`:**
    When an experiment is finished, it means you have stopped it after achieving significant results. This state indicates that the experiment is complete and no longer running.

<Note>Frequent switching between running and paused states can introduce bias into your experiment results.</Note>
