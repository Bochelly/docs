## Success events definitions
### What is a success event?
A success event in A/B testing is a predefined action or metric that determines the effectiveness of an experiment. It represents the primary outcome you want to measure to assess whether your variations outperform the control. Success events should be closely aligned with your business goals and objectives.

**Example:**
For an e-commerce website, a success event could be the completion of a purchase. Here, you would track the conversion rate, which is the percentage of visitors who complete a purchase. Other examples of success events include:
- **Clicking on a high-impact call-to-action (CTA) button** – such as "Add to Cart" or "Subscribe Now".
- **Registering for a newsletter signup** – showcasing visitor interest and potential future engagement.
- **Downloading a valuable resource or document** – such as an e-book, white paper, or case study.
- **Completing an inquiry or lead generation form** – such as requesting a demo or filling out a contact form.
- **Engaging with key interactive elements** – such as a live chat service or survey completion.

Each of these actions provides valuable insights into user behavior and helps you determine which wording or variation drives better results.

### How many success events can I define with Gleef?
Currently, you can specify one among two success event for each experiment you conduct.

1. **Click on the Call-to-Action (CTA)**
    <Warning>This option is available only if you are running an experiment on a CTA text that triggers an event when clicked.</Warning>
 
    By defining the success event as a click on the targeted CTA, we track the first time a visitor clicks the button, and then attribute that event to the specific variation being shown (if applicable).

2. **Specific URL Page**
    You can choose any URL that represents a meaningful outcome for your experiment. URLs that signal a successful event can be 'thank you' or 'purchase completed' pages. 
    
    This type of success event is especially useful when testing elements like headlines that don't involve clickable CTAs.
