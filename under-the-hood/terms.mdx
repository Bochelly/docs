_Effective as of May 1, 2024 | Posted: May 1, 2024_
This Gleef Customer Business Agreement governs your organization’s use of our A/B testing Chrome extension for wordings.
`Gleef`, `us`, `our`, and `we` refers to **Gleef SAS**, and `Customer`, `you`, and `your` refers to the organization governed by these terms.
By clicking `I agree` or `Purchase` (or a button or link with a similar meaning), signing your Order, or using the Services, you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of your organization.

If a Customer's Order contains additional terms and conditions, then those terms override these terms to the extent they conflict.


## 1. Provision of the Services to Customer
### 1.1 Right to Use the Services and Software
During the Subscription Term:
- We will provide the Services to Customer.
- We grant Customer the right to use the Services subject to this Agreement and install and use any software provided by us to access the Services in accordance with the Documentation, all subject to the terms of this Agreement.

###1.2 Restrictions on the Right to Use the Services
Customer may only use the Services:
- For its internal business purposes.
- In accordance with this Agreement, including the Documentation and the Acceptable Use Policy.
- On web domains listed on their subscription.

### 1.3 Access for End Users; Responsibility for End Users
Customer may assign End Users to use the Services. End Users may be employees or contractors of Customer or its Affiliates who are using the Services solely for the benefit of Customer or its Affiliates.

- The security of the password to access the Services’ accounts.
Customer will obtain and maintain from End Users any consents necessary to allow us to deliver the Services. End User accounts may only be used by a single End User and may not be shared by multiple individuals.

### 1.4 Changes to the Services
We may make changes to features and functionality of the Services during the Subscription Term. If we make a change to the Services that has a material adverse effect on the functionality of the Services, taken as a whole, we will notify Customer in advance.

### 1.5 No Liability for Third-Party Platforms
The Services may interoperate, integrate, or be used in connection with Third-Party Platforms. Customer’s use of a Third-Party Platform with the Services is governed by Customer’s agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Platform, not this Agreement, and we are not responsible for Third-Party Platforms.

## 2. Payment Terms

Customer will pay the fees for the Services (“Fees”) described in the Order in Euros. All payment obligations are non-cancellable, and Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or expressly set out in this Agreement.

### 2.2 Payment Timing
The payment timing is described in Customer's Order. If the payment timing is not specified in Customer’s Order, Customer will pay all Fees within thirty days of when Customer receives an invoice. Late payments are subject to a service charge of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by law.

### 2.3 Taxes
If there are any government-imposed sales, value-added, delivery, withholding, or similar taxes associated with your purchase of the Services (but not taxes based on our net income, net worth, asset value, property value, or employment) (“Taxes”),
you will pay such Taxes. Unless otherwise expressly specified in an Order and as required by applicable Law, Fees are exclusive of any Taxes.

### 2.4 Notice of Fee Changes Prior to Renewal; Notice of Corrections
In the event we change Customer's Fees, we will give Customer at least thirty days’ notice of that change prior to the renewal of Customer's then-current subscription. If Customer believes we have incorrectly billed Customer,

by posting a new version on our website.

### 3.3 Data Retention

advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that those people and entities use the received Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement.

### 4.2 Required Disclosure
The recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal Process if the recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to:
- Promptly notify the other party of such disclosure before disclosing, and

## 5. Intellectual Property Rights
### 5.1 Reservation of Intellectual Property Rights
As between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data, and we own all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services, the Documentation, and the System Data. Except as expressly stated,

- The Services provided under a free trial or program.

### 10.4 Notice Requirement
The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any allegation(s) that preceded the third-party legal proceeding and cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party
to resolve the allegation(s) and third-party legal proceeding. If breach of this notification obligation prejudices the defense of the legal proceeding, the indemnifying party's obligations will be reduced in proportion to the prejudice.

### 10.5 Sole Control Requirement

- The indemnified party may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense.
- Any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require the indemnified party's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

### 10.6 Remedies
If we reasonably believe the Services might infringe a third party's Intellectual Property Rights, then we may, at our sole option and expense:
- Procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services.
- Modify the Services to make them non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality.
- Replace the Services with a non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative.
If we can’t figure out a reasonable way to offer these remedies, we may suspend or terminate Customer's use of the Services, with a pro-rata refund of prepaid and unused Fees for the Services.

### 10.7 Indemnification is the Sole Remedy for Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights Allegations
Without affecting either party's termination rights, this Section 10 (Indemnification) states the parties' sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for any third-party allegations of Intellectual Property Rights infringement covered by this Section 10 (Indemnification).
