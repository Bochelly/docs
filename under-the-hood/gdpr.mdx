## GDPR Compliance
At Gleef, we take data privacy and security very seriously and are fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We understand the importance of protecting our users' personal data and have implemented measures to ensure the highest standards of data privacy.

### No Cookies, Local Storage Only
Gleef does not use cookies to track user behavior or store personal data. Instead, we leverage local storage to keep any necessary information on the user's device. This approach ensures that data remains secure and private, with no risk of it being inadvertently shared or exposed through third-party cookies.

### Anonymous Data Collection
We only collect anonymous data to help us improve our services and provide valuable insights for our users. This data is used strictly for analytical purposes and cannot be traced back to any individual. By anonymizing the data, we ensure that user privacy is maintained at all times.

### Data Protection Measures
To further safeguard user data, we have implemented robust security protocols and encryption methods. This ensures that any data stored locally on the user's device is protected against unauthorized access and breaches.

### User Control and Transparency
We believe in complete transparency and user control over data. Users can easily manage their local storage settings and delete any stored data if they choose to do so. We provide clear instructions on how to manage these settings, ensuring that users have full control over their information.

### Compliance and Accountability
Gleef is committed to ongoing compliance with GDPR and regularly reviews our data protection practices to ensure they meet regulatory standards. We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who oversees our compliance efforts and addresses any concerns related to data privacy.

### Summary
By not using cookies and only storing data locally, Gleef offers a secure and privacy-focused solution for A/B testing. Our commitment to anonymizing data and providing users with control over their information aligns with the core principles of GDPR. We are dedicated to maintaining the trust of our users by ensuring their data is protected and used responsibly.
