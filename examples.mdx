## Example: Using Gleef to Increase Conversion Rates
<Note>A striking +7% CTR changing a single CTA on the landing page</Note>

<Accordion title="Discover the case.">
    ### Scenario
    A loan company uses Gleef to A/B test different call-to-action (CTA) buttons on their website to increase the conversion rate of loan applications. They test three variants to see which wording encourages more users to start the loan application process.

    ### Initial Wording
    The original CTA button text is "Je demande mon crédit."

    ### Hypothesis
    The company believes that different wording on the CTA button might influence user behavior and conversion rates.

    ### A/B Test Setup
    1. **Variant A (Baseline Text):**
    - "Je demande mon crédit"

    2. **Variant B (New Text):**
    - "Commencer"

    3. **Variant C (New Text):**
    - "Simuler mon prêt"

    ### Experiment
    Using Gleef, the loan company sets up an A/B test with the three CTA button variants. They measure the conversion rate, which is the percentage of visitors who start the loan application process.

    ### Results
    - **Variant A (Je demande mon crédit):** Conversion rate is used as the baseline.
    - **Variant B (Commencer):** Conversion rate increased by 7%.
    - **Variant C (Simuler mon prêt):** Conversion rate decreased by 6%.

    ### Conclusion
    Surprisingly, the simple and direct wording "Commencer" performed significantly better, increasing the conversion rate by 7%. On the other hand, "Simuler mon prêt" led to a 6% decrease in conversion rate. The company did not anticipate that the shorter, more action-oriented text would have such a positive impact.

    ### Action
    Based on the results, the loan company decides to replace the original CTA button text with "Commencer" across their website. They also plan to use Gleef for further A/B testing on other elements to continue optimizing their conversion rates.

## Example: Using Gleef to Reduce After-Sales Questions
<Note>Reducing by more than 50% after-sales requests</Note>

<Accordion title="Discover the case.">
    ### Scenario
    A client who sells outdoor equipment online uses Gleef to A/B test different wording on their product FAQ page. Their goal is to reduce the number of after-sales questions directed to their support team by improving the clarity and helpfulness of their FAQ content.

    ### Initial Wording
    The original FAQ page has a section titled "Product Care Instructions" with the following text:
    "To ensure the longevity of your product, follow the care instructions provided."

    ### Hypothesis
    The client believes that providing more detailed and specific product care information directly on the FAQ page might reduce the number of support inquiries related to product maintenance.

    ### A/B Test Setup
    1. **Variant A (Original Text):**
    - "To ensure the longevity of your product, follow the care instructions provided."

    2. **Variant B (New Text):**
    - "To keep your equipment in top condition, clean it with mild soap and water after each use and store it in a dry place. For detailed care tips, check our Care Guide."

    ### Experiment
    Using Gleef, the client sets up an A/B test to compare the effectiveness of the two variants. They measure the number of clicks on the "Contact Support" button and the number of support tickets related to product care.

    ### Results
    - **Variant A:** more than 150 support tickets related to product care per week.
    - **Variant B:** around 100 support tickets related to product care per week.

    ### Conclusion
    Surprisingly, the new wording (Variant B) led to a 33% reduction in support tickets. The detailed care instructions provided more value to customers, reducing confusion and the need to contact support. The client did not anticipate such a significant impact from what seemed like a minor wording change.

    ### Action
    Encouraged by the unexpected positive results, the client decides to implement the new wording across their entire FAQ section. They also plan to conduct further A/B tests on other FAQ topics to continue improving customer support efficiency and satisfaction.
